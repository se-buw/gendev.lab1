## Activity: Learn about EMF, class modeling, and code generation

All tutorials should work with most versions of Eclipse Modeling Tools, but the preferred version (the last one tested) is Eclipse 2025-03 Modeling.

Please find the tutorial here: [EMF Class Modeling and Code Generation Tutorial](https://se-buw.github.io/gse/tutorials/emf/)

-   Please work on items **1 to 8** in the attached tutorial.
-   Continue with items **13 and 14** in the attached tutorial (you may use the provided archive for a working version of items 1 to 8).

If you find any inconsistencies inside the document, please post them in the discussion forum to get them fixed.

## Homework task: Create a class diagram and instances

Start from the provided template in the file gendev.lab1.zip and import it into your Eclipse.

To pass this part, you need to:

-   Create a class diagram with at least 5 classes, 1 generalization, 8 attributes (in total), and 4 associations
-   Generate code for the class diagram
-   Add OCL constraints c1 and c2 to the class diagram, including at least one that:
    -   restricts the value of an attribute
    -   navigates over multiple associations
-   For each constraint, e.g., c1, create one instance model/c1/fail.xmi that fails validation against the OCL constraint c1 and create one instance model/c1/pass.xmi that passes validation.
    -   The test cases in the project look for folders c1 and c2 to distinguish the two, but these are not related to the names of invariants in the Ecore model.

You may use the provided test cases to see your progress. All test cases should pass for your submission, but passing tests are not a sufficient criterion for passing the homework task.
